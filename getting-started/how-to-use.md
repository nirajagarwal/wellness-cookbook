## 🧑‍🍳 How to "Cook" These Recipes

### **Start Simple**
1. **Choose 1-2 recipes** from your preferred collection
2. **Begin with "appetizer portions"** (5-15 minutes)
3. **Practice consistently** for 1-2 weeks before adding more
4. **Gradually increase** serving sizes as you build the habit

### **Avoid Common Mistakes**
- **The Buffet Trap**: Don't try all 20 recipes at once
- **The Perfection Trap**: Consistency matters more than perfect execution
- **The Quick Fix Trap**: Lasting change takes time - think marathon, not sprint
