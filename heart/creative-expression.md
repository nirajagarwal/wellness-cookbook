### ‚≠ê EXPERT & USER REVIEWS

**SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH:**

*"Art making resulted in statistically significant lowering of stress. There were no statistically significant correlations between past art experience and cortisol levels, suggesting that anyone can benefit regardless of artistic skill or experience."*  
‚Äî **Kaimal et al., 2016, PLOS ONE**

*"Creative arts engagement was associated with lower incidence of frailty... Creative activities appear to protect against age-related decline through cognitive stimulation, social engagement, and enhanced sense of purpose."*  
‚Äî **Fancourt & Steptoe, 2019, British Journal of Psychiatry**

**PSYCHOLOGICAL WISDOM:**

*"Art enables us to find ourselves and lose ourselves at the same time... The creative process is a spiritual path. This adventure is about us, about the deep self, the composer in all of us, waiting to be born."*  
‚Äî **Julia Cameron, "The Artist's Way"**

*"Every child is an artist. The problem is how to remain an artist once we grow up... Art washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life."*  
‚Äî **Pablo Picasso**

**MYSTICAL TRADITIONS:**

*"Art is not what you see, but what you make others see... The artist is a receptacle for emotions that come from all over the place: from the sky, from the earth, from a scrap of paper, from a passing shape."*  
‚Äî **Edgar Degas & Pablo Picasso**

*"In the end, we are all apprentices in a craft where no one ever becomes a master... Creativity is the divine spark that ignites the soul and illuminates the world."*  
‚Äî **Ernest Hemingway & Ancient Wisdom**

**USER EXPERIENCES:**

**‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ "Therapy through art"**  
*"Started painting during divorce proceedings. Each canvas processed emotions I couldn't put into words. Six months later, anxiety gone, self-confidence soaring. Art saved my sanity."* - Rebecca M., transformational healing

**‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ "Flow state addiction"**  
*"Discovered pottery at 45. When I'm at the wheel, time disappears, stress evaporates. Two hours feels like 20 minutes. Better than any meditation app or antidepressant."* - Carlos D., flow state explorer
