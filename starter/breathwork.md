**SUPPORTING NUTRIENTS:**
- Nitric oxide release (improved circulation and immune function)
- GABA enhancement (natural anxiety relief neurotransmitter)
- Endorphin activation (natural pain relief and mood elevation)
- Acetylcholine modulation (rest-and-digest nervous system activation)
- Oxygen efficiency optimization (cellular energy and brain function)

**ESSENTIAL BREATHING TECHNIQUES:**
- **Box Breathing** (4-4-4-4 pattern for nervous system balance)
- **4-7-8 Breathing** (rapid anxiety relief and sleep induction)
- **Coherent Breathing** (5-second inhale, 5-second exhale for HRV)

### ‚≠ê EXPERT & USER REVIEWS

**SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH:**

*"Slow breathing practices enhance autonomic, cerebral and psychological flexibility... A single session of slow breathing (4.5 breaths per minute) significantly increased heart rate variability and reduced anxiety by 44%."*  
‚Äî **Zaccaro et al., 2018, Frontiers in Human Neuroscience**

*"Controlled breathing practices consistently activate the parasympathetic nervous system, leading to measurable improvements in stress resilience, emotional regulation, and cognitive performance within minutes of practice."*
