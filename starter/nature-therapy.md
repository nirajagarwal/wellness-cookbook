### üî¨ MECHANISM OF ACTION

**NEURAL PATHWAYS:**
- Reduces activity in subgenual prefrontal cortex (rumination center)
- Activates parasympathetic nervous system via vagus nerve
- Enhances alpha brain wave production (relaxed alertness)
- Restores directed attention networks through "soft fascination"

**PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS:**
- Phytoncide inhalation boosts natural killer cell activity
- Negative ion exposure increases serotonin production
- Circadian rhythm regulation through natural light cycles
- Stress hormone reduction via HPA axis downregulation

**PSYCHOLOGICAL BENEFITS:**
- Attention Restoration Theory: replenishes cognitive resources
- Biophilia activation: innate connection to living systems
- Perspective restoration: problems seem smaller in natural vastness
- Mindfulness facilitation: natural environments encourage presence

### ‚≠ê EXPERT & USER REVIEWS

**SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH:**

*"A 90-minute walk in nature reduces activity in the brain's subgenual prefrontal cortex, a region associated with depression, compared to walking in an urban environment."*  
‚Äî **Bratman et al., 2015, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences**

*"Forest bathing trips significantly increased NK activity, and the increased NK activity lasted for more than 30 days after the trip, suggesting that a forest bathing trip once a month would enable individuals to maintain higher NK activity."*  
‚Äî **Li et al., 2010, International Journal of Immunopathology and Pharmacology**

**PSYCHOLOGICAL WISDOM:**

*"Nature holds the key to our aesthetic, intellectual, cognitive and even spiritual satisfaction... We are not just observers of nature, we are nature."*  
‚Äî **E.O. Wilson, Biologist & Father of Biophilia**

*"In every walk with nature, one receives far more than they seek... Nature is not a place to visit. It is home."*
