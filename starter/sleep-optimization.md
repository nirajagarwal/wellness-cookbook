### üß™ KEY INGREDIENTS

**PRIMARY ACTIVE COMPOUNDS:**
- **Deep Sleep (N3)** (physical restoration, growth hormone release, immune enhancement)
- **REM Sleep** (memory consolidation, emotional processing, creativity)
- **Circadian Rhythm Alignment** (natural sleep-wake cycle synchronization)
- **Sleep Pressure (Adenosine)** (natural sleepiness accumulation)
- **Core Body Temperature Drop** (physiological sleep trigger)

**SUPPORTING NUTRIENTS:**
- Melatonin (natural sleep hormone regulation)
- Growth hormone (tissue repair and regeneration)
- Prolactin (immune system enhancement)
- GABA (calming neurotransmitter activation)
- Glymphatic system activation (brain waste clearance)

**ESSENTIAL SLEEP ARCHITECTURE:**
- **Sleep Onset (N1)** (transition from wake to sleep)
- **Light Sleep (N2)** (sleep spindles and K-complexes for memory processing)
- **Deep Sleep (N3)** (slow wave sleep for physical restoration)
- **REM Sleep** (rapid eye movement for cognitive and emotional processing)
- **Sleep Cycles** (90-110 minute complete cycles, 4-6 per night optimal)

**CONTRAINDICATIONS:**
- Blue light exposure 2 hours before bed (suppresses melatonin by 50%)
- Caffeine after 2 PM (6-hour half-life disrupts sleep onset)
- Large meals or alcohol near bedtime (fragments sleep architecture)
- Irregular sleep schedule (disrupts circadian rhythm stability)
- Bedroom temperature above 68¬∞F (prevents core temperature drop)
